Source Data 1: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009

Source Data 2: https://www.kaggle.com/piyushagni5/white-wine-quality

Question we hope to answer: Which classifier predicted wine ratings the best?

Database Engine: PostGres

List of Tables and Columns: Red Wine Quality, White Wine Quality

- 1 - fixed acidity

- 2 - volatile acidity

- 3 - citric acid

- 4 - residual sugar

- 5 - chlorides

- 6 - free sulfur dioxide

- 7 - total sulfur dioxide

- 8 - density

- 9 - pH

- 10 - sulphates

- 11 - alcohol

- Output variable (based on sensory data):

- 12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

Model: Classifier - Convert the quality score to "good" or "bad" (no live predictions)

Dashboard: Tableau - Interactive display of model results
